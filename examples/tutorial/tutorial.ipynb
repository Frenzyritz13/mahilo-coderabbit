    "### 1. Communication Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "Enabling effective communication between agents requires:\n",

    "- Designing protocols for agents to request information from each other\n",
    "- Ensuring messages contain appropriate context\n",
    "- Tracking conversations and maintaining state across interactions\n",
    "- Preventing infinite loops and circular references\n",

    "### 2. Observability Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "As your agent system grows, understanding what's happening becomes difficult:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tracing requests across multiple agents\n",
    "- Identifying which agent might be causing issues\n",
    "- Collecting metrics on agent performance\n",
    "- Debugging failures in a distributed system\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Human-in-the-Loop Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "Integrating human oversight adds another layer of complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Creating interfaces for humans to monitor agent activities\n",
    "- Designing effective handoff protocols between AI and humans\n",
    "- Determining when to escalate decisions to human operators"

    "\n",
    "1. **Identifying the Core Processes**: Analyzing the filmmaking process to identify distinct stages\n",
    "   that could benefit from specialization\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Defining Agent Boundaries**: Determining clear responsibilities for each agent to avoid overlap\n",
    "   and ensure clear ownership of tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Mapping Communication Flows**: Deciding which agents need to communicate with each other\n",
    "   and what information they need to exchange\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Script Writer Agent**: Creates the initial movie script based on a prompt\n",
    "2. **Story Boarder Agent**: Breaks down the script into visual scenes and shots\n",
    "3. **Director of Photography (DOP) Agent**: Generates images based on storyboard specifications\n",
    "4. **Audio Agent**: Creates audio content matching the visual scenes\n",
    "\n",
    "This architecture ensures that each stage of film production has a dedicated expert agent,\n",
    "with clear workflows between them.\n",

    "### Step 2: Designing Agent Capabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "For each agent, we needed to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define Core Competencies**: What specific tasks can this agent perform?\n",
    "2. **Design Appropriate Tools**: What functions should the agent have access to?\n",
    "3. **Craft Effective Prompts**: How should we instruct the agent to use these tools?\n",
