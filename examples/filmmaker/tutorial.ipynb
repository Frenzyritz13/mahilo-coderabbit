    "1. **Specialization**: Different agents can focus on specific tasks, leading to better\n",

    "3. **Parallel Processing**: Multiple agents can work simultaneously on different aspects\n",
    "   of a problem, increasing efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Better Accuracy**: Increasing the size of the toolset for a given agent leads to a dip in accuracy as shown by the ReWOO paper.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Built-in Observability\n",
    "\n",
    "    Mahilo provides out-of-the-box metrics, traces (in OpenTelemetry format), and logs of all\n",

    "2. Inter-Agent Communication Protocol\n",

    "2. **Defining Agent Boundaries**: Determining clear responsibilities for each agent to avoid overlap\n",
    "   and ensure clear ownership of tasks\n",

    "3. **Director of Photography (DOP) Agent**: Generates images based on storyboard specifications\n",

    "For each agent, we needed to:\n",

    "1. **Define Core Competencies**: What specific tasks can this agent perform?\n",
    "2. **Design Appropriate Tools**: What functions should the agent have access to?\n",
    "3. **Craft Effective Prompts**: How should we instruct the agent to use these tools?\n",

    "A critical aspect of multi-agent systems is ensuring data flows correctly between agents.\n",

    "   using mahilo's internal communication protocol.\n",

    "\n",
    "Based on our experience developing the filmmaker system, here are some best practices:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Clear Agent Boundaries\n",
    "\n",
    "    Define precise, non-overlapping responsibilities for each agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Why it matters*: Clear boundaries prevent confusion, reduce redundant work, and make\n",
    "the system easier to debug and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Thoughtful Prompt Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "    Craft detailed prompts that guide agent behavior and interaction patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Why it matters*: Well-designed prompts serve as both documentation and runtime\n",
    "instructions, ensuring agents behave as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Explicit Communication Guideliness\n",
    "\n",
    "    Establish when and how agents should communicate, including what information\n",
    "they should share.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Why it matters*: Without protocols, agents may overwhelm each other with irrelevant\n",
    "information or fail to share critical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Workflow Orchestration\n",
    "\n",
    "    Implement clear trigger patterns for moving from one stage to the next.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Why it matters*: Without orchestration, multi-agent systems can stall or produce\n",
    "inconsistent results.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Testing Agent Interactions\n",
    "\n",
    "    Test agent pairs in isolation before integrating them into the full system.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Why it matters*: Isolating agent interactions makes it easier to identify and fix\n",
    "communication issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Human Oversight Design\n",
    "\n",
    "    Tell the agents in their prompt about specific checkpoints where humans should review and intervene in the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Why it matters*: Human oversight improves quality and provides a safety net for\n",
    "handling edge cases and creative decisions."
